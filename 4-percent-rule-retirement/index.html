<h1>The 4% Rule for Retirement Planning</h1>
<p class="lead">How the 4% withdrawal rule works and how to estimate a retirement target using realistic assumptions.</p>
<h2>What is the 4% rule?</h2>
<p>The 4% rule suggests withdrawing about 4% of your retirement portfolio annually (adjusted for inflation) to make savings last 30 years in many historical scenarios.</p>
<h2>How to estimate your target</h2>
<p>A rough target is 25× your desired annual spending. For £30,000 per year, aim for ~£750,000 in invested assets.</p>
<h2>Risks and flexibility</h2>
<p>Markets vary. Consider flexible withdrawals, part‑time income, and maintaining a cash buffer to manage downturns.</p>
<h2>Planning steps</h2>
<p>Estimate contributions and growth, test scenarios, and review fees and inflation assumptions regularly.</p>
