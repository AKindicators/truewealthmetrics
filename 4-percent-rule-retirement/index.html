<p class="sub">How the 4% withdrawal rule works and how to estimate a retirement target using realistic assumptions.</p>
</section>
<section class="section card">
<h2>What is the 4% rule?</h2>
<p>The <strong>4% rule</strong> is a simple retirement planning guideline: you start retirement by withdrawing about <strong>4% of your portfolio in year one</strong>, then increase that pound amount each year to keep up with inflation. The idea comes from historical portfolio data over long time horizons — it’s a starting point for estimating how much you might need.</p>
<p>Before investing for retirement, you should first establish a basic financial safety buffer. Start with our guide on <a href="/how-much-emergency-fund/">how much emergency fund you need</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> it’s not a guarantee. Real life includes taxes, fees, market crashes, changing spending, and different retirement lengths. Use it as a planning <em>baseline</em>, then stress‑test with realistic assumptions.</p>
<h2>How much do you need? (the 25× shortcut)</h2>
<p>A common shortcut is: <strong>Target portfolio ≈ 25× your annual spending</strong>. That’s because 1 / 0.04 = 25.</p>
<ul><li>If you want £30,000/year in retirement spending → £30,000 × 25 = <strong>£750,000</strong>.</li><li>If you want £40,000/year → £1,000,000.</li></ul>
<p>This works best when your spending number is realistic (includes housing, utilities, food, transport, insurance, and a buffer). If you plan to spend more early in retirement (travel) or support dependents, adjust up.</p>
<h2>When the 4% rule can fail</h2>
<p>The biggest risk is <strong>sequence of returns</strong> — retiring just before a long market downturn. Early losses combined with withdrawals can damage the portfolio.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Very long retirements</strong> (35–45+ years) may need a lower starting rate.</li><li><strong>High fees</strong> can materially reduce sustainable withdrawals.</li><li><strong>All‑stock or all‑cash</strong> portfolios can increase risk (different ways).</li><li><strong>High inflation</strong> periods can stress withdrawals.</li></ul>
<h2>Smarter approach: use a range (3%–5%)</h2>
<p>For planning, treat 4% as the middle of a range:</p>
<ul><li><strong>3%–3.5%</strong> → conservative (very long retirement, higher uncertainty).</li><li><strong>4%</strong> → common baseline.</li><li><strong>4.5%–5%</strong> → aggressive (higher risk, often needs flexibility).</li></ul>
<h2>Build flexibility into your plan</h2>
<p>Real retirees adjust. Simple flexibility ideas:</p>
<ul><li>Reduce discretionary spending after bad market years.</li><li>Keep 1–2 years of cash for spending needs.</li><li>Consider part‑time income in early retirement.</li><li>Revisit asset allocation, fees, and taxes annually.</li></ul>
<h2>Next step: run the numbers</h2>
<p>Use the retirement calculator to estimate your target and test different contributions and growth rates. Then compare fee scenarios to see how much investment costs change your outcome.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<details class="faq">
<summary>Is the 4% rule safe?</summary>
<div class="faq-body"><p>It can be a reasonable baseline for many 30‑year retirements, but it’s not guaranteed. Safety depends on market returns, fees, inflation, taxes, and how flexible your spending is.</p></div>
</details>
<details class="faq">
<summary>Does the 4% rule include inflation?</summary>
<div class="faq-body"><p>Yes. The classic rule assumes you increase your withdrawal amount each year to keep up with inflation.</p></div>
</details>
<details class="faq">
<summary>Should I use 3% or 4%?</summary>
<div class="faq-body"><p>If you want a more conservative plan (very long retirement, higher uncertainty), model 3%–3.5%. Use 4% as a mid‑range reference and stress‑test both.</p></div>
</details>
<details class="faq">
<summary>Do fees matter for the 4% rule?</summary>
<div class="faq-body"><p>Yes. Ongoing fees reduce net returns, which can lower sustainable withdrawals. Comparing scenarios with and without fees is a good reality check.</p></div>
