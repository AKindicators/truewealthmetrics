        <h2>Why inflation matters</h2>
        <p><strong>Inflation</strong> is the rise in prices over time. If your money earns less than inflation, your <strong>real purchasing power</strong> declines — even if the number in your bank account goes up.</p>
        <p>Example: if inflation averages 3% and your savings earn 1%, you’re losing ~2% of purchasing power each year.</p>
        <h2>Savings vs investing</h2>
        <p>Cash is great for short‑term goals and emergencies. But for long‑term goals (10+ years), many investors use diversified portfolios because historically they have outpaced inflation over long periods.</p>
        <ul><li><strong>Use cash</strong> for: emergency fund, near‑term spending, short‑term goals.</li><li><strong>Use investing</strong> for: retirement, long‑term wealth building, goals far in the future.</li></ul>
        <h2>Real return: the number that matters</h2>
        <p><strong>Real return</strong> ≈ investment return − inflation − fees. Fees matter because they reduce your net return every year.</p>
        <p>If a portfolio returns 7% but inflation is 3% and fees are 1%, your real return is roughly 3%.</p>
        <h2>A practical strategy</h2>
        <ul><li>Keep your emergency fund in cash (safety first).</li><li>Invest surplus consistently (monthly contributions).</li><li>Keep costs low (fees, spreads, unnecessary complexity).</li><li>Stay diversified and think long‑term.</li></ul>
        <h2>Next step: compare scenarios</h2>
        <p>Use the Investment Fee Impact Calculator to see how fees change long‑term outcomes. Then use the Compound Interest Calculator to model contributions and growth over time.</p>
<p>After building an emergency fund, long-term investing becomes more relevant &mdash; especially for retirement planning. See <a href="/4-percent-rule-retirement/">the 4% rule for retirement planning</a>.</p>
