        Compound interest is one of the most powerful forces in personal finance — but most people underestimate it.
        This guide explains <strong>how compounding works</strong>, why <strong>starting early</strong> matters more than chasing high returns,
        and how <strong>monthly contributions</strong> accelerate long-term wealth.

<h2>What compound interest means (in plain English)</h2>
<p>
          Compound interest means you earn growth on your <strong>original money</strong> and on the <strong>growth you already earned</strong>.
          That’s why compounding can feel slow at first… then suddenly speed up years later.
        </p>
<p class="note">
          The biggest mistake people make is focusing only on return rate. In reality, <strong>time</strong> and <strong>consistency</strong>
          usually matter more than trying to find the “best” investment.
        </p>

<h2>A simple example that shows why starting early wins</h2>
<p>
          Imagine two people both invest <strong>£200 per month</strong>.
        </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Person A</strong> starts at age 20 and invests for 10 years, then stops.</li>
<li><strong>Person B</strong> starts at age 30 and invests for 30 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Person B invests longer — but Person A’s money has more time to compound. Depending on the return rate,
          Person A can end up surprisingly close (or even ahead) because early years have decades to grow.

<h2>The 5 factors that drive compounding</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:10px;">1) Time</h3>
<p>
          Time is the compounding multiplier. Each extra year doesn’t just add growth — it increases the compounding effect.
        </p>
<h3 style="margin-top:10px;">2) Monthly contributions</h3>
<p>
          Regular deposits are powerful because every contribution begins compounding from the moment it’s added.
        </p>
<p>
          If you’re not sure how much to save monthly, use the
          <a href="/savings-goal-calculator/"><strong>Savings Goal Calculator</strong></a>.
        </p>
<h3 style="margin-top:10px;">3) Return rate</h3>
<p>
          Return rate matters — but it’s often less important than time and contribution consistency. A disciplined plan with moderate returns
          can beat an inconsistent plan with higher returns.
        </p>
<h3 style="margin-top:10px;">4) Fees</h3>
<p>
          Fees quietly reduce your return every year. A 1% annual fee sounds small, but across 20–40 years it can remove a large chunk of your final balance.
        </p>
<p>
          Compare low-fee vs high-fee growth using the
          <a href="/investment-fee-impact-calculator/"><strong>Investment Fee Impact Calculator</strong></a>.
        </p>
<h3 style="margin-top:10px;">5) Inflation</h3>
<p>
          Inflation reduces the purchasing power of your money. Even if your investments grow, the “real” value may grow slower.
          That’s why long-term planning should consider real returns, not just nominal returns.
        </p>

<h2>Compound interest and retirement</h2>
<p>
          Retirement planning is compounding in action — usually over 30–45 years. The goal is not perfection;
          the goal is a consistent plan that compounds for decades.
        </p>
<p>
          One of the biggest hidden drags on compounding is <strong>investment fees</strong>. They reduce the balance that compounds,
          so the long-term gap can become massive.

<summary>What matters most for compounding?</summary>
