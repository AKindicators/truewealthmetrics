<h1>How Much Emergency Fund Do You Need?</h1>
<p class="lead">Learn how to size, build, and store an emergency fund to protect your finances and avoid debt.</p>
<h2>What is an emergency fund?</h2>
<p>An emergency fund is cash set aside to cover unexpected expenses like job loss, medical bills, or urgent repairs. It prevents high‑interest debt and keeps long‑term investments intact.</p>
<h2>How much should you keep?</h2>
<p>Common guidance is 3–6 months of essential expenses. If income is unstable or you are self‑employed, lean toward 6–9 months. Start with a starter fund of £1,000 and build gradually.</p>
<h2>Where to store it</h2>
<p>Use a high‑yield savings account or easy‑access cash ISA. The goal is safety and liquidity, not return. Avoid stocks for emergency reserves.</p>
<h2>How to build it fast</h2>
<p>Automate transfers from each paycheck, redirect windfalls, and temporarily reduce discretionary spending. Pair a monthly budget with a savings goal plan to track progress.</p>
