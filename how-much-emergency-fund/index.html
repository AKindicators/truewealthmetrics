<h2>What is an emergency fund?</h2>
<p>An <strong>emergency fund</strong> is cash set aside for unexpected events: job loss, urgent repairs, medical costs, or short‑term income disruption. It protects you from high‑interest debt and stops you from selling long‑term investments at the wrong time.</p>
<h2>How much should you save?</h2>
<p>A practical target is based on <strong>months of essential expenses</strong> (rent/mortgage, utilities, food, transport, insurance, minimum debt payments):</p>
<ul><li><strong>3 months</strong>: stable income, dual income household, low fixed costs.</li><li><strong>6 months</strong>: default target for most people.</li><li><strong>9–12 months</strong>: variable income, self‑employed, single income, dependents, or higher uncertainty.</li></ul>
<p>If you’re starting from zero, build a <strong>starter fund</strong> first (e.g., £500–£1,000). Then increase it month by month until you hit your target range.</p>
<h2>Where to keep your emergency fund</h2>
<p>Emergency money needs to be <strong>safe and accessible</strong>. Common options:</p>
<ul><li>High‑yield savings account</li><li>Easy‑access cash ISA (UK)</li><li>Premium Bonds (UK) as part of the buffer</li></ul>
<p>Avoid putting emergency funds in volatile assets (stocks/crypto) because you might need the money during a downturn.</p>
<h2>How to build it faster</h2>
<ul><li>Automate a fixed transfer on payday.</li><li>Send windfalls (bonus, tax refund) straight to the fund.</li><li>Cut one recurring expense temporarily until you hit your starter fund.</li><li>Use a simple budget to identify “leakage” categories.</li></ul>
<h2>After the emergency fund: what next?</h2>
<p>Once you have a solid buffer, it often makes sense to: (1) pay down high‑interest debt, and (2) start investing consistently for long‑term goals.</p>
<p>Understanding inflation is also important when deciding emergency savings size — see our guide on <a href="/inflation-vs-investing/">inflation vs investing</a>.</p>
