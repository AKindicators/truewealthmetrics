<h1>About TrueWealthMetrics</h1>
<p class="sub">
          TrueWealthMetrics is a free finance calculator site built to help people estimate outcomes before making real money decisions.
          Our tools focus on clarity — budgeting, debt payoff planning, loan and mortgage estimates, and long-term investing and retirement
          projections.
        </p>

<h2>What we do</h2>
<p>
          We publish practical personal finance calculators and educational pages designed to be fast, mobile-friendly, and usable without signup.
          The goal is to help you understand the numbers behind common money decisions — so you can compare scenarios and plan with more confidence.
        </p>
<h2>How to use the calculators</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use results as planning estimates, not guarantees.</li>
<li>Double-check inputs (rates, fees, balances) and compare scenarios.</li>
<li>For major decisions, consider speaking with a qualified professional.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>
          We aim for simple inputs, transparent outputs, and practical explanations. Calculators are designed to be fast, mobile-friendly,
          and usable without signup.
        </p>

<h2>Editorial Responsibility &amp; Review Process</h2>
<p>
          All calculators, educational pages, and financial explanations published on TrueWealthMetrics are created and maintained by the
          <strong>TrueWealthMetrics Editorial Team</strong>.
        </p>
<p>
          Our editorial responsibility is to ensure every tool and article is understandable, transparent, and mathematically accurate.
          Before publication, each calculator is manually tested using multiple scenarios (different rates, time periods, contribution amounts,
          and edge-case inputs) to verify that outputs behave consistently and logically.
        </p>
<p>
          Educational content is written to explain financial concepts such as compound growth, debt amortization, investment fees, and retirement
          projections in plain language. We aim to help users understand how financial decisions affect long-term outcomes, not to promote specific
          financial products.
        </p>
<h2>Experience &amp; Expertise</h2>
<p>
          TrueWealthMetrics is built by a team experienced in financial modelling, probability-based projections, and risk analysis. The calculators
          on this website are not generated from templates — they are individually designed using widely accepted financial mathematics, including
          compound interest formulas, amortization schedules, and long-term return assumptions.
        </p>
<p>
          Our experience comes from practical work building financial planning models, analysing long-term saving behaviour, and studying how small
          variables (interest rates, fees, contribution timing, and compounding frequency) significantly impact financial outcomes over time.
        </p>
<p>
          Rather than offering personal financial advice, we focus on helping users understand the mechanics behind financial decisions so they can
          make more informed choices.
        </p>
<h2>Transparency &amp; Limitations</h2>
<p><strong>Financial projections are estimates, not predictions.</strong></p>
<p>
          All results produced by TrueWealthMetrics calculators depend entirely on the inputs provided by the user and on simplified assumptions
          (such as constant rates of return or fixed interest rates). Real-world financial markets, inflation, taxes, and behavioural decisions may
          lead to different outcomes.
        </p>
<p>
          For this reason, our tools should be used for <strong>planning and education only</strong>. For major financial decisions, users should
          consult a qualified financial professional.
        </p>
<h2>Accountability</h2>
<p>
          TrueWealthMetrics operates as an educational financial resource. We welcome corrections, feedback, or questions about any calculator or
          article.
        </p>
<p>
          If you believe a calculation is incorrect or unclear, please contact us and include the page URL and your input values so we can review it.
        </p>

          Email: <a href="mailto:support@truewealthmetrics.com">support@truewealthmetrics.com</a>
</p>
<p>
          We review all feedback and update tools when improvements or corrections are needed.
